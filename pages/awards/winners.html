            The AFRIMA annual adjudication calendar commences with the Call for
            Entry process where Artistes, Songwriters, Video Directors, Music
            Producers, Disc-Jockeys (DeeJays) and Choreographers/Dancers on the
            African continent and in the Diaspora are required to submit their
            works within the stipulated validity timeline and this occurs over a
            period of 12 weeks.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the Entry Submission period closes, the Screening Committee of
            AFRIMA meets to sieve through the thousands of works received via
            the AFRIMA website to verify each entry adheres to the submission
            guidelines and requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Afterwards, the 13-man International Jury of AFRIMA meets for 12
            days (based on dates on the annual AFRIMA calendar) to review,
            assess and grade the pre-screened entries submitted by African
            artistes. During this painstaking and careful process, the Jury is
            bond by the AFRIMA Values of FACE IT –Fairness, Authenticity,
            Creativity, Excellence, Integrity and Transparency in arriving at
            the final Nominees List for the year of the awards.
          </p>
          <p>
            The 13-man Jury is structured into two representatives from each
            region of Africa. Then, there are two other Jurors each one
            representing Africa in the diaspora –Europe and North America;
            another Juror representing the African Union and the final Juror
            representing the International Committee of AFRIMA.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Annual AFRIMA Nominees List is eventually released to the public
            after the Jury Adjudication process has been concluded.
          </p>
          <p>
            Award winners in the 39 categories emerge through a voting process
            that occurs via the AFRIMA International Voting Academy and the
            African Public.
          </p>
          <p>
            Besides the 13-man Jury panel, the AFRIMA International Voting
            Academy is also made up of the 100-man College of Voters which
            consists of experienced African music professionals, scholars,
            DJays, VJays and renowned music enthusiasts who will cast their
            votes for nominees based on the technical/production quality,
            originality/creativity and artistic merits of the works. Academy
            Voting and Public Voting is done strictly online on www.afrima.org
          </p>
          <p>
            The International Committee of AFRIMA and the College of Voters
            exclusively decide two categories of the awards, the AFRIMA Legend
            Award and the Producer of the Year respectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the conclusion of the Voting Process, AFRIMA International
            Auditors will collate the votes and present the sealed results to
            the award producer on the main award ceremony day. The nominee (s)
            with the highest number of total votes in each category wins the
            AFRIMA trophy. The integrity of the process is such that the Public
            and Academy members have no way of knowing how any other person
            votes.
